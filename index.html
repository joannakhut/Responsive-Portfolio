                Hello! My name is Joanna. I enjoy working on cars, trying new places to eat, going to the track to
                drift my 240sx,
                and petting every animal that crosses my path. Learning how to code & develop content from scratch is a
                new recreation of mine that is also very familiar. It takes me back to the time of Myspace.
                We all turned our backs on Tom, but it was thanks to him that some of this is was familiar. Sorry Tom,
                I promise I will credit you for all my future coding endeavors!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been in the automotive industry for about five years.
                I started with aftermarket parts sales, then logistics for online parts sales, and now I do all of that
                with some web development.
                I work with the Shopify platform to reach out to customers all over the world. I want to learn more
                about web developement/ coding so I can help others
                create their own windows to the world of e-commerce. The world of tech is constantly changing and I
                want to evolve with it.
            </p>
